Changes in opm-material 2016.04
===============================

- Improvements to the ECL/Black-Oil related functionality:
 - Support for Leverett-like capillary pressure scaling. (The "JFUNC"
   keyword.)
 - Support for dissolution limits based on the maximum observed
   saturation of the oil phase. (The "VAPPARS" keyword.)
 - Most (all?) consistency checks for saturation functions have been
   removed. They are now supposed to be done by higher-level modules
   like opm-simulators.
 - The BlackoilFluidSystem can now be queried about which components dissolve 
   in which phases.
- Various improvements related to the dense automatic differentiation code:
 - The namespace which contains that functionality was changed from
   "Opm::LocalAd" to "Opm::DenseAd".
 - Toolbox::toLhs() has been renamed to Toolbox::decay().
 - The isnan() and isfinite() functions have been added for Evaluations.
 - A briefer alternative syntax for calling mathematical functions for
   Evaluations has been added: e.g. Opm::sqrt(x) can be now used instead of
   Opm::MathToolbox<Eval>::sqrt(x).
 - Various smaller bugfixes; e.g., calling pow() with a base of 0.0
   does not produce NaNs anymore.
- Fluid states can now specify whether a phase should be assumed to be present 
  independently of the phase's saturation.
- Better support for single precision floating point scalars has been
  added: "Extremely large" values are now expressed using 10^30
  instead of 10^100 since the latter is too large to be represented by
  single-precision IEEE-754 floating point objects.
